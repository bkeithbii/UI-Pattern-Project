# Slideshow-API

Built a slider UI that lists the top 15 leading scorers of the NBA through February of the 2019-2020 regular season. 

## Prerequisites

- Javascript
- DOM 
- API's
- CSS
- HTML
- Github

## Requirements

Students were tasked with picking a UI design (my selection was the slider UI) and connecting it with an API ([NBA Stats](https://any-api.com/nba_com/nba_com/docs/API_Description)) of their choice to interact together. 

## Deployment

My work was deployed with GitHub Pages [here](https://bkeithbii.github.io/UI-Pattern-Project/). 

## Attributions 

Data pertaining to each NBA player was sourced directly from [NBA Stats API](https://any-api.com/nba_com/nba_com/docs/API_Description).

## Future Updates

Will seek to have the site update itself as the leaderboard changes as the season progresses. Potentially change event listeners to increase the user experience. 

## How-To-Use

```
1. Upon opening the site please refresh until you see "James Harden" as the first player in the slideshow.
2. In order to show the players stats and bio click once on their image.
3. To remove the current players information double click on their image.
4. Be sure to remove their information prior to going to the next slide which can be done by clicking either basketball on each side of the current player.
```
